* Regulations

  There aren't many rules, but you *must* ensure images used are allowed by
  their respective authors. If using a copyrighted image, the image's license
  should be compatible, or you must obtain express permission.

* Image Recommendations

  Images should be 1024x1024 recommended, 512x512 minimum.

  We'd love it if images were PNGs, to avoid unnecessary backgrounds.
